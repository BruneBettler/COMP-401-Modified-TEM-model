## About The Project

The Tolman-Eichenbaum Machine (TEM), inspired by cognitive mapping theories, is a successful computational model of the rodent hippocampus and entorhinal cortices. While TEM successfully forms stereotypical neuronal classifications found in rodents such as place, grid, and border cells, its application to primate models and more complex associative memory tasks remains unexplored. This study aims to modify the TEM model to better accommodate complex tasks akin to those performed by primates. Specifically, the modified TEM model is trained on data from an associative memory task completed by monkeys. We hypothesize that after training, our modified TEM model will contain neurons with firing patterns similar to those found in the primate hippocampus during the completion of the same task. By modifying TEM, we aim to develop a more comprehensive model of the hippocampal formation that not only spans across species but also provides deeper insights into this regionâ€™s roles in memory and navigation in both spatial and non-spatial contexts.

This code is a modification of the Tolman-Eichenbaum Machine model in pytorch for miniGrid environments.
